COPS links to your Calibre library database and allows downloading and emailing of books directly from a web browser and provides a OPDS feed to connect to your devices. Changes in your Calibre library are reflected immediately in your COPS pages. See : [COPS's home](http://blog.slucas.fr/en/oss/calibre-opds-php-server) for more details. Don't forget to check the [Wiki](https://github.com/seblucas/cops/wiki). ## Why? (taken from the author's site) In my opinion Calibre is a marvelous tool but is too big and has too much dependencies to be used for its content server. That's the main reason why I coded this OPDS server. I needed a simple tool to be installed on a small server (Seagate Dockstar in my case). I initially thought of Calibre2OPDS but as it generate static file no search was possible. Later I added an simple HTML catalog that should be usable on my Kobo. So COPS's main advantages are : *No need for many dependencies.* No need for a lot of CPU or RAM. *Not much code.* Search is available. *With Dropbox / owncloud it's very easy to have an up to date OPDS server.* It was fun to code. If you want to use the OPDS feed don't forget to specify feed.php at the end of your URL.
